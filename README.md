## Prerequisites

The plugin assumes that sbt-native-packager has been included in your SBT build configuration. This can be done by
adding the plugin following instructions at
[scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager) or by adding another plugin that
includes and initializes it (e.g. the SBT plugin for Play Framework 2.4.x).


## Installation for sbt-native-packager > 1.0.0 and Play Framework > 2.4.0

Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.jatescher" % "sbt-jolokia" % "1.1.2")
```

To use the Jolokia settings in your project, add the `Jolokia` auto-plugin to your project.

```scala
enablePlugins(Jolokia)
```

## Configuration

To use a specific `jolokia-jvm` version, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
jolokiaVersion := "1.3.7"
```

## Testing

This project uses `sbt-scripted` to run its tests. To test this project run:

```shell
$ sbt scripted
```
